<h1>SynPhony Settings</h1>
<p><button>Store Settings</button> Click the button to store any changes you made.</p>
<p><button>Restore Default Settings</button> Click the button to reset all changes back to their default values.</p>

<h2>User Interface Language</h2>
<p><strong>Select an interface language:</strong> The default interface language is English. You can change the
	user interface language by selecting a language from the drop down selector. If you are interested in
	translating the interface to another language please contact the development team for instructions on how to
	contribute to this effort.</p>

<h2>Control Panel settings</h2>
<p><strong>Width of control panel:</strong> The default is 215px. Change this to control the width of the control panel.</p>
<p><strong>Size of letter buttons font:</strong> The default is 16px. The setting affects the letter buttons in the control panel.
	Increase the number to make the letter buttons larger.
	Decrease the number to make the letters smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Number of letter buttons to display:</strong> The default is 50. You can change the number of letter buttons that
	appear in the letters section by changing this number. If the language has more spelling patterns than the number you
	specify, then you will see a number and left (◀) and right (▶) arrows beside it. You can see the next or previous set of spelling
	patterns by clicking on the arrows.</p>
<p><strong>Number of syllable checkboxes to display:</strong> The default is 4. You can change the number of syllable checkboxes
	to display by increasing or decreasing this number. Each checkbox searches for words with the
	given number of syllables (if they exist in the database).</p>
<p><strong>Number of column checkboxes to display:</strong> The default is 4. You can change the number of column radio button
	to display on the Activity Controls. Each radio button sets the number of columns to use when displaying words on the
	Activity Area.</p>
<p><strong>Preferred Button Sequence:</strong> There are two options to use. Choose one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity Sequence:</strong> The Productivity Sequence is a sequence that SynPhony has calculated to give you
	the greatest number of new words at every step if you would use all the words in the database. In reality you might not use
	all the words available but restrict your search to shorter words. You may also have pedagogical reasons for deviating from
	the productivity sequence. If you wish to change the order use the next option.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Sequence:</strong> If you want to change the order in which the letter buttons appear in the Control Panel you can
	specify the order in this option. Note that you do NOT need to specify all of the letters in order to change the sequence.
	The letters you specify in the text box will be placed first in the sequence, followed by the rest of the letters in the order
	of the Productivity Sequence. Separate each letter with a space.</p>

<h2>Assessment settings</h2>
<p><strong>Timed Reading Length:</strong> This feature is still under construction.</p>

<h2>Testing an Orthography setting</h2>
<p><strong>Enable Orthography Testing feature:</strong> This checkbox can be used for testing an orthography. If you select it you
	will see a new button <button>Replace with:</button> and textbox appear in the Word List Activity, at the top of the page. You
	can use the page as usual if you don't put anything into the box or press the button.</p>
<p>If you want to replace the focus letter (the letter in red if &ldquo;Highlight&rdquo; is turned on) with another letter, then
	type the letter you want to use into the textbox and click the <button>Replace with:</button>  button. When you press the button
	all of the displayed words will have the previous focus letter replaced with the letter you typed into the box. If you press the
	button again, the original letter will reappear.</p>
<p>This feature can be used to quickly change the character of the focus letter to something else. It lets you and others see what
	the words would look like if it used a different character for a phoneme or tone marker.</p>
<p><strong>Replace letters with IPA symbols:</strong> Selecting this checkbox will replace the letters of the words that get
	displayed with IPA symbols (if that information has been supplied and stored in the language database). This is a temporary
	transformation; it can be disabled at any time by unselecting the checkbox and the words will be displayed with their original
	letters again.</p>
