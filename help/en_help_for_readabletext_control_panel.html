<h1>SynPhony Help</h1>
<h2>The Control Panel</h2>
<p>The entire Control Panel can be hidden and revealed by clicking on the little tab thingy with your mouse.
The width of the panel can be changed in the <span class="menu_ref">Settings</span>
menu which is accessible from the <span class="menu_ref">Home</span> page.</p>
<h3 class="u">Options Section</h3>
<img alt="" src="../graphics/options.png">
<p>The Options Section gives you controls for selecting words from the
database. You may click on the header text to hide or show the section.</p>

<h4>Vocabulary group: 1<input type="checkbox" /> 2<input type="checkbox" /> ...</h4>
<p>If the database has multiple groups defined then the Vocabulary group checkboxes
appear. They let you select vocabulary from different groups of words.</p>

<h4>Syllables: 1<input type="checkbox" /> 2<input type="checkbox" /> ...</h4>
<p>These checkboxes control how many syllables the selected words may
have. You may select more than one checkbox at a time. It is possible
that you may not see any words for some selections you make.</p>

<h4>Show only taught letters: <input type="checkbox" /></h4>
<p>By default this checkbox is selected. If it is selected then SynPhony ensures
that all of the displayed words contain only letters that have been taught already.
If it is not selected then clicking on a letter will display all words that
contain that letter without regard to any other letters in the word. </p>

<h4>Show all readable words:<input type="checkbox" /></h4>
<p>If this checkbox is selected SynPhony finds the words that are composed only
of the letters that have been taught already even if they do not contain the focus
letter. If this is not selected then SynPhony ensures that each vocabulary word must
contain at least one instance of the focus letter for the current lesson. This
focussed list finds the words that are useful for the current lesson.</p>

<h4>Parts of Speech: nouns<input type="checkbox" /> verbs<input type="checkbox" />...</h4>
<p>If the database contains parts of speech information then the Parts of
Speech checkboxes appear. They allow you to restrict the word
list to words of the selected parts of speech.</p>

<h4><button style="font-size: 14px;">Clear history</button></h4>
<p>Clicking this button clears all the selected letters and allows you to start
over again.</p>

<h3 class="u">Letters Section</h3>
<img alt="" src="../graphics/letters.png">
<p>The Letters Section lists the different letters or digraphs that exist in the
language. You may click on the header text to hide or show the section.</p>

<h4>Searching for words</h4>
<p>Clicking on the letters will cause SynPhony to search and display words that can be
composed completely of letters that have been selected. It is recommended to start
by clicking on letters in the top two rows. However, it is not necessary to use the
given order for your sequence. If you wish, you may select letters in
<span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span> order and SynPhony will always try to find
words which match the selected letters and display them to you. However, it is possible
that when you click a letter that the page does not display any new words. If that
happens you can either, 1) add another vocabulary group to the current one or,
2) select an additional syllable length or, 3) select additional letters.</p>

<h4>Letter button order</h4>
<p>By default the letters are ordered in the most productive order from top left to bottom
right. The productive order is one that gives you greatest increase in the number of words
each time you introduce a new letter. You may change the order in which the letters appear
by clicking on the <span class="menu_ref">Settings</span> icon on the
<span class="menu_ref">Home page</span>, and then specifying a different order in the Custom
Sequence field. You must separate each letter with a space.</p>

<h4>Letter Page control <span style="padding-left: 10px;">&#x25C0; 2 &#x25B6;</span></h4>
<p>If the language has more letters than can fit on one section then a number and a black
triangle will appear in the header that allows you to see the next page. The number of
letter buttons that get displayed in the Letters Section can be changed by clicking on the
<span class="menu_ref">Settings</span> icon on the <span class="menu_ref">Home page</span>.
The default number of letter buttons in this section is 50.
