<h3>The Top Bar</h3>
<p>This area contains the page title and the main menu. It is always visible. The login link
lets you sign a person in and allows the computer to keep track of their progress. The main
menu contains a number of different icons to access the various features of the program.</p>
<ul>
<li class="icon home">The <span class="menu_ref">Home</span> page contains larger menu icons as well as the <span class="menu_ref">Settings</span> page.</li>

	letters you control.</li>

	real word lists.</li>
<li class="icon storytool">The <span class="menu_ref">Story Checking Tool</span> page lets you check a sentence or a story to

<h3>The Control Panel</h3>
<p>The Control Panel contains the options used to control what you see in the Activity Area.
The content in Control Panel changes depending on the Activity you have selected from the
Main Menu. The Control Panel can be hidden by clicking on the little tab thingy that pops
out when you hover over it with your mouse. There can be multiple sections in the Control
Panel. The headers for each section are collapsible so that you can hide or display them
if you need to.</p>

<h3>The Activity Area</h3>
<p>The Activity Area displays the results of the Control Panel. It often looks like a
virtual, white page. The content in the Activity Area depends on the Activity you have
selected in the Main Menu. For example, if you are creating word lists,
then the white page displays the words which SynPhony has found based on the options you
have selected. If you have selected the Word Search page then the Activity Area displays
the word search puzzle.</p>

<h3>The Activity Controls</h3>
<p>The Activity Controls give you additional control over various aspects of the content
that gets displayed in the Activity Area. If the content is a word list then the Activity
Controls do not change the actual words but only change the appearance or the order of the
words on the page.</p>

<h3>The Footer</h3>
<p>The Footer contains information regarding the program as well as an email link you can
use to ask for help.</p>
