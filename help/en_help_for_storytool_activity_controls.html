<h1>SynPhony Help</h1>
<h2>Story Checking Tool</h2>
<img alt="" src="../graphics/story_tool_page.png">
<p>The Story Checking Tool lets you type or paste a sentence or story into the text box and check
to see how much of the text can be read by a student. </p>

<h3>Legend</h3>
<p>The Legend indicates the colors used for marking up the sentence or story.</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="fo">Focus words</span> are words that are usable in a lesson because they have the letter which the
		lesson focusses on.</li>
	<li><span class="cu">Good words</span> are words that are readable because they contain only letters which have been
		taught in previous lessons. These words belong to the Cumulative Word List.</li>
	<li><span class="po">Possible words</span> that may be readable but for one reason or another SynPhony cannot know
		for sure. This means that the user should check to see if the word is really readable or not. Some of the reasons
		why SynPhony treats these words as Possible is that it contains all the letters that have been taught but the
		actual word is not in the Target word list or in Good word list (or Cumulative Word List). This can happen because
		the word is longer and the user has not selected the appropriate Syllable length checkbox. Another reason may be
		that the word does not exist in SynPhony's database.</li>
	<li><span class="sight">Sight words</span> are words that are needed to make a sentence or story but also contain letters
		that have not been taught yet.</li>
	<li>All other words will have the default background color. This indicates that the word is not
		suitable for the lesson because it contains letters that have not been taught yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sight Words section</h3>
<p>The Sight Words section can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the text &ldquo;Sight Words&rdquo;
Any word you type into this text box will be considered a &ldquo;sight word&rdquo; and, if it exists in
the story you are checking, will be highlighted with <span class="sight">this color</span>. If you need to
specify several words then separate each word with a space.
</p>

<h3>Target Words</h3>
<p>The Target Words section contains words that are suitable for the current lesson. The list of words reflect
	the selections in the Options section of the Control Panel. The list of words will change depending on how many
	syllable and the &ldquo;Show all:&rdquo; checkboxes have been selected.
</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>This textbox lets you enter a sentence or a story so you can check how much of the text is readable at any
	particular lesson.</p>

<h3><button style="font-size: 14px;">Check Story</button></h3>
<p>Pressing this button causes SynPhony to check the text that has been entered in the textbox above
	and add colors to words to indicate how suitable it is for a lesson.</p>
