<h1>Synthetic Phonics teaching principles</h1>
	<p>Here are some general principles to use when teaching someone to read.</p>
	<h2>Two foundational skills must be learned</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Letters represent sounds.
			<blockquote>Teach a child the sound a letter represents. Knowing a letter's name is also useful but it can be taught later.
			</blockquote>
		</li>
		<li>How to blend letters (sounds) into words.
			<blockquote>Blending is the process of sounding out the letters all through the word from beginning to end.</blockquote>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>Each time you select a new letter a new set of words will be presented. The
goal is to get the learner to use their knowledge of letter sounds to blend them into
recognizable words. Do not pronounce the words for the learner. Let them
do all the hard work of figuring out how to pronounce a word. If they make a mistake, focus their attention
on the letter where they made the mistake and get them to repeat the sound of that
letter and then ask them to read the word again.</p>

<h2>Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is the ability to sound out a word based on the reader's understanding
of the sounds letters represent. Each new letter pattern gives a reader
the ability to read many new words, sometimes hundreds of new words at
a time.</p>

<h2>Reading fluency</h2>
<p>At each stage the learner should repeat the words until they can read
them at a natural speaking rate, or about 40-60 words per minute or 1 word
per second. At this speed the brain has absorbed the letter to sound relationship
and can work with it at the sub-conscious level. When the learner can read the
current words at this speed they can move to the next lesson. You can
randomize the order of the words on the page by checking the "sort randomly"
checkbox.</p>

<h2>Vocabulary and Comprehension</h2>
<p>When a child has read a word successfully, but you suspect that they don't
know what it means, you can stop and talk about the word. Give a short, easy definition
and use it in a sample sentence. While learning one new letter can enable a child to
read many new words, the meanings of words must be learned one at time.</p>

<h2>Writing Practise</h2>
<p>Writing exercises can be easily made from the words you see
on the screen by clicking on the &ldquo;Writing practise&rdquo; link. Print out the page
and teach the learner to sound out each letter as they write it down. After
a word is written completely the child should read the whole word before
proceeding to the next one. This reinforces the letter-sound relationship
in the mind of the learner.</p>

<h2>Spelling Practise</h2>
<p>Spelling is the reverse of reading and can be taught from the very beginning.
At each stage a teacher or parent can use the words that have been
presented in the current lesson to practice spelling. Read a word out
loud to the learner and ask them to write it out.</p>

<h2>Reviewing</h2>
<p>It is easy to review previously learned letters and should be done
regularly, especially if you notice that the learner is making mistakes on a letter.
Simply unselect and then re-select the letter button you wish to review.
When you review previous letters you will usually get more vocabulary than when
you first encountered the letter. This makes for good practise with new words.</p>
