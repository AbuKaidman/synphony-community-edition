<h2>Readable Text Controls Section</h2>
<p>The Readable Text search function searches through text to find connected text
material that is decodable at various stages of learning to read. The search results
can be used as examples of text that is readable.</p>

<h3>Activity Controls</h3>
<img alt="" src="../graphics/readabletext_controls.png">
The Activity Controls section contains a variety of options that let you change the
appearance and layout of the activity on the page.<br>

<h4><button>Find Readable Text</button></h4>
<p>Clicking this button causes the program to search through the available texts
for connected text that is readable. Readable text is defined as those words that are
decodable based on which letters have been selected.</p>

<h4>Text size <button>&ndash;</button> <button>+</button></h4>
<p>Clicking the plus and minus buttons changes the size of the words on the page.</p>

<h4>Mininum Words <input type="text" maxlength="2" size="2" value="3"></h4>
<p>The default number is 3. This number sets the minimum number of decodable words a
text chunk must have in order to be displayed. The text chunk can be a sentence or it
can contain multiple sentences.</p>

<h4>Items per page <input type="text" maxlength="3" size="3" value="50"></h4>
<p>The default value is 50. This number controls how many search results are displayed
per page. If there are more than can fit on one page then you can click on the black
arrows below the title "Readable Text" on the display page to see the other pages.</p>

<h4>Sorting <select><option>Sort by percent</option></select></h4>
<p>You can sort the readable text search results in different ways.
<ul>
	<li>The Sort by percent orders the text chunks by percentage of readable text.
		 The list is sorted in descending order.</li>
	<li>Sort by matched words orders the text chunks by the greatest number
		of matched words. The list is sorted in descending order.</li>
	<li>Sort by consecutive words orders the text chunks by the greatest number of
		consecutive decodable words. The list is sorted in descending order.</li>
</ul>
